# pi
Final version of the code for Pi, an Arduino-based MIDI drumkit 

Pi is an Arduino-based MIDI drumkit created by Computer Science Undergrad students and bandmates Dan Friedman & Tom Kearney. Pi was designed, developed and produced in January of 2013 as a J-term project for Oberlin College. 

Building Pi entailed 3 components:
1. Designing the drum pads, physical housing, and octave switching system.
2. Building the circuit to convert physical vibrations (drum strikes) to 5v signal inputs.
3. Programming the Digital Signal Processing algorithm to read the drum pad inputs and produce relevant MIDI data.
